Requirements
🎯 Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk.
🎯 Create and display an error/not found page if the user visits a page that doesn’t exist.
🎯 Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive component, or something similar (e.g. use of a different component library to enhance UX, not just Tailwind).
🎯 Enable users to create a user profile, and input profile information (such as a user biography) using a form. Users and user information should be stored in their own table in the database and handled with an appropriate route.
🎯 Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the user’s profile page.

Stretch Requirements
🏹 Allow users to update their content. You can achieve this either with a dynamic route (“/posts/[id]/edit”) or by creating a modal.
🏹 Allow users to delete their content.
🏹 Allow users to view other profiles directly from posts they see on the global timeline, using a dynamic users route (e.g. /user/[userId]).
🏹 Let users follow each other by establishing a follower and followee relationship between profiles.
🏹 Enable users to like posts by linking their user_id to the liked_post in a junction table.
🏹 Ensure that a user’s biography cannot be left blank. If a user logs in without one, prompt them to add this information.
🏹 Create and display an error/not found page if the user visits another users profile that doesn’t exist.
